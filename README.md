# PirModels

This package is based on activities of the [OGMP](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/ogmp/) (i.e, priori to 2002), and
becomes open source as part of [MFannot](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/RNAweasel/).

All this files provides a simple way to model data objects, each file is a specific PirModels.
For more information about the PirObject library, please consult the [PirObject](https://github.com/prioux/PirObject) github page.

This repository contain all the PirModels needed by [umac](https://github.com/BFL-lab/umac), [HMMsearchWC](https://github.com/BFL-lab/HMMsearchWC) and other programs developped at OGMP.

Since some of the models are used by more than one program we decide to put all together in a single repository, for better maintainability.
