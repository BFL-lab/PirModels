# PirModels

This package is based on activities of the OGMP, and becomes open source as part of MFannot.

All this files provides a simple way to model data objects, each file is a specific PirModels. 
For more information about the PirObject library, please consult the [PirObject](https://github.com/prioux/PirObject) github page.

This repository contain all the PirModels needed by [MFannot](https://github.com/natacha-beck/MFannot), [HMMweasel](https://github.com/natacha-beck/HMMweasel), [RNAweasel](https://github.com/natacha-beck/HMMweasel), [mf2sqn](https://github.com/natacha-beck/mf2sqn). 

Since some of the models are used by more than one program we decide to put all together in a single repository, for better maintainability.
