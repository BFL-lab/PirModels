# PirModels

This package is based on activities of the [OGMP](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/ogmp/) (i.e, priori to 2002), and
becomes open source as part of [MFannot](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/RNAweasel/).

All this files provides a simple way to model data objects, each file is a specific PirModels. 
For more information about the PirObject library, please consult the [PirObject](https://github.com/prioux/PirObject) github page.

This repository contain all the PirModels needed by [MFannot](https://github.com/natacha-beck/MFannot), [HMMweasel](https://github.com/natacha-beck/HMMweasel), [RNAweasel](https://github.com/natacha-beck/RNAweasel), [mf2sqn](https://github.com/natacha-beck/mf2sqn), [umac](https://github.com/natacha-beck/umac). 

Since some of the models are used by more than one program we decide to put all together in a single repository, for better maintainability.
